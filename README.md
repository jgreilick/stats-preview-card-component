## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to overlay a partially transparent background color over a background image.  I gained more comfortability and insight into the box model and building responsive
layouts.  I found dealing with the image and responsive resizing to be challenging, but I was able to work through it to develop a solution that I am happy with.

### Continued development

I am continuing to learn and solidify the basics of HTML and CSS with these 'newbie' challenges from Frontend Mentor.  I plan to continue this process of creating and then
viewing solutions.  I still have much to learn from each challenge.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - An excellent comprehensive resource, my 'go-to' for all things front end.
